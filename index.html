            <p>Bali, the famed Island of the Gods, with its varied landscape of hills and mountains, rugged coastlines
                and sandy beaches, lush rice terraces, and volcanic hillsides all providing a picturesque backdrop to
                its colorful, deeply spiritual, and unique culture stakes a serious claim to be paradise on earth. With
                world-class surfing and diving, a large number of cultural, historical, and archaeological attractions,
                and an enormous range of accommodations, this is one of the world's most popular island destinations and
                one which consistently wins travel awards.</p>

            <h1>Worth knowing about Bali</h1>
            <p>Bali is one of more than 17,000 islands in the Indonesian archipelago and is located just over 2
                kilometers
                (almost 1.5 miles) from the eastern tip of the island of Java and west of the island of Lombok. The
                island,
                home to about 4 million people, is approximately 144 kilometres (90 mi.) from east to west and 80
                kilometres
                (50 mi.) north to south.
                The word "paradise" is used a lot in Bali and not without reason. The combination of friendly,
                hospitable
                people, a magnificently visual culture infused with spirituality, and (not least) spectacular beaches
                with
                great surfing and diving have made Bali Indonesia's unrivaled number one tourist attraction. Eighty
                percent
                of international visitors to Indonesia visit Bali and Bali alone.</p>

            <p>Bali is an island province in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago made up of over 17,500 separate islands
                that span a massive 1.9 million square kilometres. Indonesia is located in the southern hemisphere of
                Southeast Asia and extends all the way from Asia to Australia. It shares land borders with the countries
                of Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and East Timor-Leste.
                Indonesia is also part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, a large area in the Pacific basin famous for its
                earthquakes and volcanic activity. The Ring of Fire is home to 75% of the world's active and dormant
                volcanoes, many of which can be found in Indonesia. With Java to the west and Lombok to the east, Bali
                itself sits roughly 8 degrees south of the equator.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>The weather in Bali can be divided into two main seasons, wet and dry. As the names imply the major
                difference between the two seasons comes down to rainfall. For those looking for bright sunny days with
                little to no chance of rain, the dry season goes from May through till September. But for those not
                deterred by some rainfall, the temperatures during the wet season still remain high as Bali enjoys a
                tropical climate.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Bali has a modern and efficient airport nowadays. In fact, it's one of my favorite airports in Southeast
                Asia! Based on customer satisfaction levels, the Bali airport was even rated the world's third best by
                Airport Council International in 2016. The Denpasar International Airport (code: DPS) is also known as
                Ngurah Rai International Airport. It
                served more than 24 million passengers in 2019, but everything is operated quite smoothly so you'd never
                know the airport is that busy! There are direct flights to Bali from Europe, the Middle East, Asia,
                Australia, and other places around
                the world.</p>
